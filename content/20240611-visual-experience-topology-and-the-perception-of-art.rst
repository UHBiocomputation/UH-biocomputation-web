:summary: Shabnam Kadir's Journal Club session where she will talk about "Visual experience, topology, and the perception of art".

On this week's Journal Club session, Shabnam Kadir will talk about her work in the presentation entitled "Visual experience, topology, and the perception of art".

------------

The brain has access to visual information via a variety of neural codes, e.g. there are
cells tuned to edge orientation, spatial frequency, edges, corners, contrasts and colour.
Higher cortical areas of the brain are thought to then further process visual information
as well as integrate a visual scene with other senses and the conscious mind. How this
visual information is combined with experience to form a holistic experience that elicits
an emotional response of pleasure, distress and/or other forms of meaning is an active
research question. The human perception of art and the question of what constitutes art
touch upon all these elements of perception and integration. We shall show how topology
provides a vital new lens in examining these questions.

We discuss recent work where methods from applied topology, namely persistent homology 
of certain cubical complexes, are applied to images produced by both a human artist and 
a neural network shown in two exhibitions in Torun, Poland. The images shown in the two 
exhibitions were matched for certain information-theoretic pixel-based characteristics. 
Experimental measurements of EEG, tracking of eye movement, as well as conscious 
perception/appreciation of these paintings were collected from a selection of visitors 
to these exhibitions, namely second-year art students.
