On this week's Journal Club session, Jim Bower will talk about the paper "Metabolic activity organizes olfactory representations".

------------

Hearing and vision sensory systems are tuned to the natural statistics of acoustic and
electromagnetic energy on earth and are evolved to be sensitive in ethologically relevant
ranges. But what are the natural statistics of odors, and how do olfactory systems exploit
them? Dissecting an accurate machine learning model (Lee et al., 2022) for human odor
perception, we find a computable representation for odor at the molecular level that can
predict the odor-evoked receptor, neural, and behavioral responses of nearly all
terrestrial organisms studied in olfactory neuroscience. Using this olfactory
representation (principal odor map [POM]), we find that odorous compounds with similar POM
representations are more likely to co-occur within a substance and be metabolically
closely related; metabolic reaction sequences (Caspi et al., 2014) also follow smooth
paths in POM despite large jumps in molecular structure. Just as the brain’s visual
representations have evolved around the natural statistics of light and shapes, the
natural statistics of metabolism appear to shape the brain’s representation of the
olfactory world.
