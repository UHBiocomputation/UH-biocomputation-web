On this week's Journal Club session, Ohki Katakura will talk about his work in the talk entitled "How the cerebellum recognises learnt and novel patterns: computational approach with a biologically detailed network model".

------------

The cerebellum is essential for motor control, timing and cognition. Although its anatomy
and physiology have been investigated, recent experimental studies raise new open
questions. These include how the granule cells process mossy fibre signals and how the
Purkinje cells code learnt and novel patterns. In this research, a detailed cerebellar
cortex network model was constructed by incorporating existing models [1,2] and
introducing long-term depression at granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses. The network
connectivity switches between the oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity states,
affecting the sparsity of activated granule cells. Pattern recognition criteria differed
across these states: in the oscillatory network, novel prompted longer pauses in Purkinje
cell spikes, while the non-oscillatory network responded with longer bursts. The number of
storable patterns in the network corresponds to the sparsity of activation.
