On this week's Journal Club session, Reinoud Maex will talk about his work in the presentation entitled "A mechanism for ATP homeostasis based on activity-dependent synthesis and release of neurotransmitter".

------------

It has long been recognised that many neurotransmitters bear a close relationship, for
their synthesis or degradation, to compounds of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle, the central
pathway for the production of the energy intermediary adenosine triphosphate (ATP). How
neurons maintain an almost constant level of ATP in their cytosol, in spite of varying
workloads, is still an outstanding question. Taking the relationship between glutamate
(Glu) and alpha-ketoglutarate as an example, a simple metabolic model was built of a Glu-
releasing axon terminal. The model included the interconversion between Glu and alpha-
ketoglutarate, the accumulation of Glu in synaptic vesicles, and the recycling of Glu
through an activity-induced supply of its precursor glutamine by the perisynaptic
astrocyte. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, the model was reduced to two differential
equations of the cytosolic concentration of Glu and ATP. This model showed remarkable
characteristics: at steady state, irrespective of the workload, the ATP level measured 1.5
mM, and only 4.7 \% of the ATP was spent on Glu release and recycling. The speed of ATP
homeostasis was determined by the (absolute) amount of ATP the axon spent on vesicular Glu
accumulation. Overall, homeostasis came at little cost as it prevented futile ATP
production when the workload decreased. These analytical and numerical results indicate
that neurotransmitter release may confer to neurons a metabolic advantage in the form of a
more accurate ATP homeostasis.
