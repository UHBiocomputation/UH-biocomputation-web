:summary: Reinoud Maex's Journal Club session where he will talk about "An analytical model of the energy of ion mixing in the brain".

On this week's Journal Club session, Reinoud Maex will talk about his work in the presentation entitled "An analytical model of the energy of ion mixing in the brain".

------------

Neurons store energy in the ionic concentration gradients they build between their cell
interior and the extracellular space. They can subsequently use this energy to do work,
such as charging their membrane capacitor, transporting metabolites across their cell
membrane, etc. During hyperactivity or energy deprivation the ions mix and the neurons
swell. In this presentation I will show how a single principle, namely that neurons try to
maximize the energy stored, can explain three unrelated phenomena: a) why extracellular
space occupies a volume fraction of about 20\%, b) why neurons swell during energy
deprivation, and c) why calcium ions are so heavily buffered.
