On this week's Journal Club session, Emil Dmitruk will talk about his work in the presentation entitled "Topological Data Analysis Reveals Brain Connectivity Differences between Schizophrenia Subjects and Healthy Controls".

------------

The aim of this study is to reveal structural connectivity patterns prevalent across a
large population and whether any of these patterns differ between schizophrenia subjects
(SCH) and healthy controls (HC). We use topological data analysis methods, namely
persistent homology using the weight rank clique filtration on brain connectivity matrices
obtained from a probabilistic fibre-tracking algorithm run on the Centre for Biomedical
Research Excellence (COBRE) dataset (N = 44 SCH, N = 44 HC) to investigate group
differences. We show that some of the connectivity structures differ in strength relative
to connectivity structures affecting other brain regions. These differences would not have
been apparent using traditional methods that explore only the absolute strength of
connectivity between regions. We show that many connectivity structures (cycles) are
shared among numerous subjects and some of the cycles are significantly different between
the two studied populations- both on a whole brain level (all cycles combined), and also
at the level of individual cycle classes. Brain regions involved in cycles that were found
were mentioned in studies of brain alteration in schizophrenia, e.g. precuneus, motor,
visual, and parietal cortices (the last being tied to experiences of psychosis). We show
that HC and SCH subjects share a lot in their structural connectome and the effect of
schizophrenia is an alteration in the relative strength, as measured by topological
persistence, of various white matter connectivity structures. We believe that further
studies could lead to prognostication for individual patients and be the first step to
developing personalised treatment.
