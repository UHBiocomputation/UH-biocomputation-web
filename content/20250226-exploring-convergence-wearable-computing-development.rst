On this week's Journal Club session, Caroline McMillan will talk about her work in the presentation entitled "Exploring Convergence Wearable Computing Development".

------------

Wearable technologies draw on a range of disciplines. Due to methodological differences,
wearables researchers can experience gaps or breakdowns in values, goals, and vocabulary
when collaborating. This situation makes wearables development challenging, even more so
when technologies are in the early stages of development, and their technological and
cultural potential is not fully understood. Investigating a common ground to enhance
convergent spaces in research allows researchers and developers to share information
across domains, encouraging divergent perspectives, creativity, and inclusiveness. By
presenting an example of an online search interface that allows users to explore wearable
technologies beyond their discipline, the authors show how users with different mindsets
and skills can engage with information and expand and share knowledge when developing
wearables.
