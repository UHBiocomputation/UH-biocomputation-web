On this week's Journal Club session, David Haydock will talk about the paper entitled "EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks: A review".

------------

The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state
activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method
involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as
successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field
remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-
scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across
time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these
microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious
mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of
mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes
associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the
temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source
imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-
state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of
EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time
scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available
methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these
microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.
