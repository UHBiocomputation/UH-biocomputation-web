title = "Odour Localization in Neuromorphic Systems",
abstract = "Odour source localization is crucial in life-saving scenarios like pinpointing gas leaks, detecting explosives, searching for earthquake survivors, or locating fires at their origin. The turbulent character of natural environments makes this task very challenging. The absolute concentration of odour plumes carries little meaning and these plumes are only encountered in an intermittent, transient fashion. However, navigation algorithms that are driven by odour encounter events, can successfully find odour sources by extracting spatiotemporal information. The event driven nature of odour plumes motivates a fully event-driven sensing and processing pipeline for robot navigation. Hence, we developed a spiking neural network, implemented on neuromorphic hardware, that can successfully decode odour-puff direction from a pair of enose-systems. This is to our knowledge the first fully event driven neuromorphic system for odour localization.",

title = "Medical Image Character Recognition Using Attention-Based Siamese Networks for Visually Similar Characters with Low Resolution",
abstract = "The emergence of optical character recognition (OCR) has been adopted in many domains to automate various tasks. Still, recognising visually similar characters (VSC) remains a challenging problem in the general OCR domain. Applying conventional class probability predictions by deep learning techniques may be difficult due to the limited datasets in some domains, such as medical imaging modalities. VSC recognition becomes more complicated due to the image{\textquoteright}s low resolution and background interference. With advancements in computing power and numerical methods, techniques such as the few-shot method have been proposed to tackle the limited sample problems in training deep learning models. Still, very little work has been done regarding designing an OCR solution to deal with tiny burnt-textual data on low-resolution images with background interference while training on small samples per class. In this study, we propose an Attention-based Siamese Network to accurately recognise VSC by efficiently learning the semantic similarities between the extracted embeddings from the input images. The learned similarities and attention-focused feature extraction layer enable the proposed model to discriminate between different character classes efficiently, with only small samples available. Bayesian optimisation is used to determine optimal network parameters. We aim to set a benchmark for the performance of the Siamese network in OCR in medical image character recognition in terms of parameter size and accuracy at a determined sample size.",

title = "The verification of periodicity with the use of recurrent neural networks",
abstract = "The ability to automatically and robustly self-verify periodicity present in time-series astronomical data is becoming more important as data sets rapidly increase in size. The age of large astronomical surveys has rendered manual inspection of time-series data less practical. Previous efforts in generating a false alarm probability to verify the periodicity of stars have been aimed towards the analysis of a constructed periodogram. However, these methods feature correlations with features that do not pertain to periodicity, such as light-curve shape, slow trends, and stochastic variability. The common assumption that photometric errors are Gaussian and well determined is also a limitation of analytic methods. We present a novel machine learning based technique which directly analyses the phase-folded light curve for its false alarm probability. We show that the results of this method are largely insensitive to the shape of the light curve, and we establish minimum values for the number of data points and the amplitude to noise ratio.",

title = "Decoding the amplitude and slope of continuous signals into spikes with a spiking point neuron model",
abstract = "In this study, we harness the signal processing potential of neurons, utilizing the Izhikevich point neuron model to efficiently decode the slope or amplitude of fluctuating continuous input signals. Using biophysically detailed compartmental neurons often requires significant computational resources. We present a novel approach to create behaviours and simulate these interactions in a lower-dimensional space, thereby reducing computational requirements. We began by conducting an extensive search of the Izhikevich parameter space, leading to the first significant outcome of our study: i) the identification of optimal parameter sets for generating slope or amplitude detectors, thereby achieving signal processing goals using neurons. Next, we compared the performance of the slope detector we discovered with a biophysically detailed two-compartmental pyramidal neuron model. Our findings revealed several key observations: ii) bursts primarily occurred on the rising edges of similar input signals, iii) our slope detector exhibited bidirectional slope detection capabilities, iv) variations in burst duration encoded the magnitude of input slopes in a graded manner. Overall, our study demonstrates the efficient and accurate simulation of dendrosomatic behaviours. Real-time applications in robotics or neuromorphic hardware can utilize our approach. While biophysically detailed compartmental neurons are compatible with such hardware, Izhikevich point neurons are more efficient. This work has the potential to facilitate the simulation of such interactions on a larger scale, encompassing a greater number of neurons and neuronal connections for the same computational power.",

abstract = "Game reviews function as an important customercreated resource for game studies as they allow practitioners and developers to analyse players'opinions.Despite this,there are few studies that under take comparative evaluations of topic modelling approaches in the context of video game data analysis or assess the results' practical efficacy. Accordingly, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of three topic modelling algorithms LDA, NMF and BERTopic–as utilised within game reviews study and further to examine the results' reception within the video game industry. This study first uses the game No Man's Sky as a case study to evaluate the performance of different models in the same game context. According to our experiments based on Steam game reviews, the topic's Uci coherence score as identified by the BERTopic model can reach 0.279, which is higher than the other two models, with the extracted keywords allowing humans to interpret the themes when mapping them to original reviews. Semi-structured interviews with seven developers are then presented which demonstrate that the information we provided is useful to improve their games and track players' opinions.",

title = "Evolutionary optimization of policy responses to COVID-19 pandemic via surrogate models",
abstract = "The spread of COVID-19 has caused a great series of negative effects on countries around the world. To curb the pandemic, many governments apply a variety of strict measures including the closure of public places, transportation systems, etc. This paper proposes an algorithm that searches through a set of government policies and selects the policies that minimize the growth rate of the pandemic with minimum cost to society. The proposed algorithm first builds a surrogate model of the pandemic and then searches through the set of government policies via an evolutionary algorithm. The surrogate model in this paper is an ensemble of several learning algorithms that uses a meta-learning algorithm that estimates where in the feature space each of the learning algorithms performs better and then gives a higher weight to the learning algorithm in the voting process. Because using the surrogate models as the fitness function induces uncertainty, in this paper we use an uncertainty reduction mechanism to perform a search through the search space better. Data from 124 countries are used in this paper which contains information about the policies each government has taken since the beginning of the pandemic and 75 environmental factors like climate, religion, politics, economy, etc. Several experimental studies are performed on the output of the modeling system and the optimization algorithms and comparisons are performed with state-of-the-art methods.",

title = "Mathematical Modelling of PI3K/Akt Pathway in Microglia",
abstract = "The motility of microglia involves intracellular signalling pathways that are predominantly controlled by changes in cytosolic Ca2+ and activation of PI3K/Akt (phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B). Herein, we develop a novel biophysical model for cytosolic Ca2+ activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in microglia where Ca2+ influx is mediated by both P2Y purinergic receptors (P2YR) and P2X purinergic receptors (P2XR). The model parameters are estimated by employing optimisation techniques to fit the model to phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) experimental modelling/in vitro data. The integrated model supports the hypothesis that Ca2+ influx via P2YR and P2XR can explain the experimentally reported biphasic transient responses in measuring pAkt levels. Our predictions reveal new quantitative insights into P2Rs on how they regulate Ca2+ and Akt in terms of physiological interactions and transient responses. It is shown that the upregulation of P2X receptors through a repetitive application of agonist results in a continual increase in the baseline [Ca2+] which causes the biphasic response to become a monophasic response which prolongs elevated levels of pAkt.",

title = "Energy optimisation predicts the capacity of ion buffering in the brain",
abstract = "Neurons store energy in the ionic concentration gradients they build across their cell membrane.The amount of energy stored, and hence the work the ions can do by mixing, can be enhanced by the presence of ion buffers in extra- and intracellular space.Buffers act as sources and sinks of ions, however, and unless the buffering capacities for different ion species obey certain relationships, a complete mixing of the ions may be impeded by the physical conditions of charge neutrality and isotonicity. From these conditions, buffering capacities were calculated that enabled each ion species to mix completely.In all valid buffer distributions the Ca++ ions were buffered most, with a capacity exceeding that of Na+ and K+ buffering by at least an order of magnitude. The similar magnitude of the (oppositely directed) Na+ and K+ gradients made extracellular space behave as a Na+--K+ exchanger. Anions such as Cl- were buffered least.The great capacity of the extra- and intracellular Ca++ buffers caused a large influx of Ca++ ions as is typically observed during energy deprivation.These results explain many characteristics of the physiological buffer distributions but raise the question how the brain controls the capacity of its ion buffers. It is suggested that neurons and glial cells, by their great sensitivity to gradients of charge and osmolarity, respectively, sense deviations from electro-neutral and isotonic mixing, and use these signals to tune the chemical composition, and buffering capacity, of the extra- and intracellular matrices.",

abstract = "This paper summarizes the structure and findings from the first Workshop on Troubles and Failures in Conversations between Humans and Robots. The workshop was organized to bring together a small, interdisciplinary group of researchers working on miscommunication from two complementary perspectives. One group of technology-oriented researchers was made up of roboticists, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers and dialogue system experts. The second group involved experts from conversation analysis, cognitive science, and linguistics. Uniting both groups of researchers is the belief that communication failures between humans and machines need to be taken seriously and that a systematic analysis of such failures may open fruitful avenues in research beyond current practices to improve such systems, including both speech-centric and multimodal interfaces. This workshop represents a starting point for this endeavour. The aim of the workshop was threefold: Firstly, to establish an interdisciplinary network of researchers that share a common interest in investigating communicative failures with a particular view towards robotic speech interfaces; secondly, to gain a partial overview of the “failure landscape” as experienced by roboticists and HRI researchers; and thirdly, to determine the potential for creating a robotic benchmark scenario for testing future speech interfaces with respect to the identified failures. The present article summarizes both the {"}failure landscape{"} surveyed during the workshop as well as the outcomes of the attempt to define a benchmark scenario.",

title = "A probabilistic meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm for image multi-level thresholding",
abstract = "The spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged many countries. To curb the effect of the pandemic requires the development of low-cost and rapid tools for detecting and diagnosing the patients. In this regard, chest X-ray scan images provide a reliable way of detecting the patients. One limitation, however, is the need for experts to analyse the images and identify the cases which can be a burden, when a large number of images are to be processed. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to extract rapidly, from the X-ray images, the regions in which there exist indications of COVID-19 infection. To identify the regions, image segmentation is required which is performed in this paper with a novel optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm uses probabilistic representation for the solutions. To improve the optimization process, we propose a diversity preserving operator. For multi-level image thresholding via optimization algorithms, different fitness functions have been proposed in the literature. In the proposed method in this paper, we use three fitness functions to benefit from the advantages of all. A fitness swapping scheme is proposed which swaps between the fitness functions in the optimization process. Also, a diversity preserving operator is proposed in this paper which compares the individuals and reinitializes the similar ones to inject diversity in the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of COVID-19 benchmark images and experimental analysis suggest better performance for the proposed algorithm.",

title = "Autapses enable temporal pattern recognition in spiking neural networks",
abstract = "Most sensory stimuli are temporal in structure. How action potentials encode the information incoming from sensory stimuli remains one of the central research questions in neuroscience. Although there is evidence that the precise timing of spikes represents information in spiking neuronal networks, information processing in spiking networks is still not fully understood. One feasible way to understand the working mechanism of a spiking network is to associate the structural connectivity of the network with the corresponding functional behaviour. This work demonstrates the structure-function mapping of spiking networks evolved (or handcrafted) for a temporal pattern recognition task. The task is to recognise a specific order of the input signals so that the Output neurone of the network spikes only for the correct placement and remains silent for all others. The minimal networks obtained for this task revealed the twofold importance of autapses in recognition; first, autapses simplify the switching among different network states. Second, autapses enable a network to maintain a network state, a form of memory. To show that the recognition task is accomplished by transitions between network states, we map the network states of a functional spiking neural network (SNN) onto the states of a finite-state transducer (FST, a formal model of computation that generates output symbols, here: spikes or no spikes at specific times, in response to input, here: a series of input signals). Finally, based on our understanding, we define rules for constructing the topology of a network handcrafted for recognising a subsequence of signals (pattern) in a particular order. The analysis of minimal networks recognising patterns of different lengths (two to six) revealed a positive correlation between the pattern length and the number of autaptic connections in the network. Furthermore, in agreement with the behaviour of neurones in the network, we were able to associate specific functional roles of locking, switching, and accepting to neurones.",

abstract = "Generally, Medical Imaging Modalities (MIM)have a distinctive nature of low contrast, complex background, and low resolution, containing burned-in textual data of patients. The conventional OCRs hardly recognise these burned-in textual data under these conditions, as they are designed for mainly bilevel text with a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. With a focus on solving these challenges, an enhanced CNN model for medical image character recognition (MICR) is proposed in this paper. The Lenet-5 architecture inspires this proposed Model. To further enhance this new technique to recognise visually similar characters, this paper proposes an ensemble classifier of CNN base learners. Intensive experiments are done using an open source medical imaging dataset. The problem of low resolution at96dpi and background interference is targeted by using small 3 X3 CNN filters to extract local features and changing the pooling layer to a learning layer by replacing it with 5 X 5 filters with astride of 2 and training on a low-resolution character dataset. The final prediction is based on a majority voting algorithm. The consensus of the base learners improves the model{\textquoteright}s stability in recognising visually similar characters. Finally, our proposed models and the Lenet-5 are compared using the Medpix medical image collection. Further investigation shows that our proposed model shows a 10% increase in accuracy compared with the base model and other past algorithms in recognising burned-in textual data on medical imaging modalities.",

abstract = "Objective The spread of the COVID-19 disease has caused great concern around the world and detecting the positive cases is crucial in curbing the pandemic. One of the symptoms of the disease is the dry cough it causes. It has previously been shown that cough signals can be used to identify a variety of diseases including tuberculosis, asthma, etc. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to diagnose the COVID-19 disease via cough signals.Methods The proposed algorithm was an ensemble scheme that consists of a number of base learners, where each base learner used a different feature extractor method, including statistical approaches and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic feature extraction. Features were extracted from the raw signal and some transforms performed it, including Fourier, wavelet, Hilbert-Huang, and short-term Fourier transforms. The outputs of these base-learners were aggregated via a weighted voting scheme, with the weights optimised via an evolutionary paradigm. This paper also proposed a memetic algorithm for training the CNNs in the base-learners, which combined the speed of gradient descent (GD) algorithms and global search space coverage of the evolutionary algorithms.Results Experiments were performed on the proposed algorithm and different rival algorithms which included a number of CNN architectures in the literature and generic machine learning algorithms. The results suggested that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance compared to the existing algorithms in diagnosing COVID-19 via cough signals. Conclusion COVID-19 may be diagnosed via cough signals and CNNs may be employed to process these signals and it may be further improved by the optimization of CNN architecture.",

title = "Enhancing Cross-Subject Motor Imagery Classification in EEG-Based Brain–Computer Interfaces by Using Multi-Branch CNN",
abstract = "A brain–computer interface (BCI) is a computer-based system that allows for communication between the brain and the outer world, enabling users to interact with computers using neural activity. This brain signal is obtained from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. A significant obstacle to the development of BCIs based on EEG is the classification of subject-independent motor imagery data since EEG data are very individualized. Deep learning techniques such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) have illustrated their influence on feature extraction to increase classification accuracy. In this paper, we present a multi-branch (five branches) 2D convolutional neural network that employs several hyperparameters for every branch. The proposed model achieved promising results for cross-subject classification and outperformed EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, DeepConvNet, MMCNN, and EEGNet_Fusion on three public datasets. Our proposed model, EEGNet Fusion V2, achieves 89.6% and 87.8% accuracy for the actual and imagined motor activity of the eegmmidb dataset and scores of 74.3% and 84.1% for the BCI IV-2a and IV-2b datasets, respectively. However, the proposed model has a bit higher computational cost, i.e., it takes around 3.5 times more computational time per sample than EEGNet_Fusion.",

The aim of this research is to study how ChatGPT can be used in academia to improve teaching/learning activities. In this paper, we study students{\textquoteright} opinions about how the tool can be used positively in learning activities. A survey is conducted among 430 students of an MSc degree in computer science at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, and their opinions about the tool are studied. The survey tries to capture different aspects in which the tool can be employed in academia and the ways in which it can harm or help students in learning activities. The findings suggest that many students are familiar with the tool but do not regularly use it for academic purposes. Moreover, students are skeptical of its positive impacts on learning and think that universities should provide more vivid guidelines and better education on how and where the tool can be used for learning activities. The students{\textquoteright} feedback responses are analyzed and discussed and the authors{\textquoteright} opinions regarding the subject are presented. This study shows that ChatGPT can be helpful in learning/teaching activities, but better guidelines should be provided for the students in using the tool.",

abstract = "Customer churn remains a critical challenge in telecommunications, necessitating effective churn prediction (CP) methodologies. This paper introduces the Enhanced Gradient Boosting Model (EGBM), which uses a Support Vector Machine with a Radial Basis Function kernel (SVMRBF) as a base learner and exponential loss function to enhance the learning process of the GBM. The novel base learner significantly improves the initial classification performance of the traditional GBM and achieves enhanced performance in CP-EGBM after multiple boosting stages by utilizing state-of-the-art decision tree learners. Further, a modified version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using the consumption operator of the Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (AEO) method to prevent premature convergence of the PSO in the local optima is developed to tune the hyper-parameters of the CP-EGBM effectively. Seven open-source CP datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the developed CP-EGBM model using several quantitative evaluation metrics. The results showed that the CP-EGBM is significantly better than GBM and SVM models. Results are statistically validated using the Friedman ranking test. The proposed CP-EGBM is also compared with recently reported models in the literature. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art models showcases CP-EGBM's promising improvements, making it a robust and effective solution for churn prediction in the telecommunications industry.",

abstract = "Evolutionary algorithms have been successfully employed to find the best structure for many learning algorithms including neural networks. Due to their flexibility and promising results, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have found their application in many image processing applications. The structure of CNNs greatly affects the performance of these algorithms both in terms of accuracy and computational cost, thus, finding the best architecture for these networks is a crucial task before they are employed. In this paper, we develop a genetic programming approach for the optimization of CNN structure in diagnosing COVID-19 cases via X-ray images. A graph representation for CNN architecture is proposed and evolutionary operators including crossover and mutation are specifically designed for the proposed representation. The proposed architecture of CNNs is defined by two sets of parameters, one is the skeleton which determines the arrangement of the convolutional and pooling operators and their connections and one is the numerical parameters of the operators which determine the properties of these operators like filter size and kernel size. The proposed algorithm in this paper optimizes the skeleton and the numerical parameters of the CNN architectures in a co-evolutionary scheme. The proposed algorithm is used to identify covid-19 cases via X-ray images.",

In this study, we proposed an agent-based model, to predict passengers{\textquoteright} travel behaviour over a period of time, particularly when the urban structure changes. The model includes passenger characteristics, transitions in travel demands between activities over time, and their movement in space and time. In addition, we innovatively calibrated the agent based model locally using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to account for geographical variations in the parameters of destination attractiveness and travel cost in the agent-based model. We conducted a case study in Ningbo, China, using trip diaries, census data, and over 1.5 million taxi trip records. Our agent-based model showed superior performance in predicting citizens{\textquoteright} movements and activities after a new shopping area in Ningbo was built, compared with a model without local calibration. The results also revealed the geographic sensitivity to destinations and the effects of a passenger{\textquoteright}s motivations that underpin human movement.",

abstract = "Automatic fault diagnosis in many systems is performed via the analysis of vibration data in the time or frequency domain. In the literature, many approaches for extracting featured from signals for fault diagnosis have been proposed. In this paper, we apply a variety of transform functions including Fourier, Wavelet, etc. to extract features from the vibration data, which includes the statistical features and some features automatically extracted via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For each of these feature extraction approaches, a learning algorithm is trained to diagnose the faults and their results are aggregated in an ensemble machine learning algorithm. The weights of the base learner algorithms are optimized via an evolutionary algorithm to achieve the best-weighted voting scheme. The architecture of CNNs has a significant effect on the performance of the algorithm, thus, in this paper, an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to find the best architecture for CNNs in fault diagnosis. The CNNs are trained via gradient descent algorithms which suffer from getting stuck in local optima. To manage this, we propose an evolutionary algorithm that benefits from the speed of gradient descent and the global search of evolutionary algorithms. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of benchmark problems and the experimental results are presented.",

abstract = "DBSCAN is arguably the most popular density-based clustering algorithm, and it is capable of recovering non-spherical clusters. One of its main weaknesses is that it treats all features equally. In this paper, we propose a density-based clustering algorithm capable of calculating feature weights representing the degree of relevance of each feature, which takes the density structure of the data into account. First, we improve DBSCAN and introduce a new algorithm called DBSCANR. DBSCANR reduces the number of parameters of DBSCAN to one. Then, a new step is introduced to the clustering process of DBSCANR to iteratively update feature weights based on the current partition of data. The feature weights produced by the weighted version of the new clustering algorithm, W-DBSCANR, measure the relevance of variables in a clustering and can be used in feature selection in data mining applications where large and complex real-world data are often involved. Experimental results on both artificial and real-world data have shown that the new algorithms outperformed various DBSCAN type algorithms in recovering clusters in data.",

abstract = "Abstract—EEG microstates are brief periods of time during which the brain{\textquoteright}s electrical activity remains stable. The analysis of EEG microstates can help to identify the background neuronal activity at the millisecond level. The main objective of this study is to observe changes in brain microstates by varying demand during different experiment phases, involving a fatiguing exercise. The hypothesis explored in this paper is that resting state and fine motor states involve different neural assemblies and that physical fatigue induced using a wrist dumbbell flexion/extension exercise impacts these microstates. An experiment is conducted with 5 healthy participants, exploring this. Three distinct microstates are observed during the resting state and a separate set of 3 states are observed during the Nine Hole Peg Test. Changes are assessed by utilising microstate parameters such as occurrence, coverage, duration, and global explained variance. It is found that the coverage of microstate C for resting states decreases for all the participants after the dumbbell exercise. During the fine-motor task, the coverage of microstate MS3 decreases for all participants except one. These results support the involvement of different neural assemblies, but also highlight the potential that physical fatigue can be observed and identified by assessing changes in microstate features, in this case, a parameter such as coverage.",

abstract = "Chest radiographs are the initial diagnostic modality for lung or chest-related conditions. It is believed that radi- ologist{\textquoteright}s availability is a bottleneck impacting patient{\textquoteright}s safety because of long waiting times. With the arrival of machine learning and especially deep learning, the race for finding artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches that allow for the highest accuracy in detecting abnormalities on chest radiographs is at its peak. classification of radiographs as normal or ab- normal is based on the training and expertise of the reporting radiologist. The increase in the number of chest radiographs over a period of time and the lack of sufficient radiologists in the UK and worldwide have had an impact on the number of chest radiographs assessed and reported in a given time frame. Substantial work is dedicated to machine learning for classifying normal and abnormal radiographs based on a single pathology. The success of deep learning techniques in binary radiograph classification urges the medical imaging community to apply it to multi-label radiographs. Deep learning techniques often require huge datasets to train its underlying model. Recently, the availability of large multi-label datasets has ignited new efforts to overcome this challenging task. This work presents multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based models trained on publically available CheXpert multi-label data. Based on common pathologies seen on chest radiographs and their clinical significance, we have chosen pathologies such as pulmonary odema, cardiomegaly, atelectasis, consolidation and pleural ef- fusion. We trained our models using different projections such as anteroposterior (AP), posteroanterior (PA), and lateral and compared the performance of our models for each projection. Our results demonstrate that the model for the AP projection outperforms the remaining models with an average AUC of 0.85. Furthermore, we use the samples with uncertain labels in CheXpert dataset and improve the model performance by removing the uncertainty using gaussian mixture models (GMM). The results show improvement in all three views with AUCs ranging from 0.91 for AP, 0.75 for PA and 0.85 on the lateral view.",

abstract = "Neurons spend most of their energy building ion gradients across the cell membrane. During energy deprivation the neurons swell, and the concomitant mixing of their ions is commonly assumed to lead toward a Donnan equilibrium, at which the concentration gradients of all permeant ion species have the same Nernst potential. This Donnan equilibrium, however, is not isotonic, as the total concentration of solute will be greater inside than outside the neurons. The present theoretical paper, in contrast, proposes that neurons follow a path along which they swell quasi-isotonically by co-transporting water and ions. The final neuronal volume on the path is taken that at which the concentration of impermeant anions in the shrinking extracellular space equals that inside the swelling neurons. At this final state, which is also a Donnan equilibrium, all permeant ions can mix completely, and their Nernst potentials vanish. This final state is isotonic and electro-neutral, as are all intermediate states along this path. The path is in principle reversible, and maximizes the work of mixing.",

abstract = "Background: As technology becomes more sophisticated, more accessible methods of interpretating Big Data become essential. We have continued to develop Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals (CEPS) as an open access MATLAB{\textregistered} GUI (graphical user interface) providing multiple methods for the modification and analysis of physiological data. Methods: To demonstrate the functionality of the software, data were collected from 44 healthy adults for a study investigating the effects on vagal tone of breathing paced at five different rates, as well as self-paced and un-paced. Five-minute 15-s recordings were used. Results were also compared with those from shorter segments of the data. Electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA) and Respiration (RSP) data were recorded. Particular attention was paid to COVID risk mitigation, and to parameter tuning for the CEPS measures. For comparison, data were processed using Kubios HRV, RR-APET and DynamicalSystems.jl software. We also compared findings for ECG RR interval (RRi) data resampled at 4 Hz (4R) or 10 Hz (10R), and non-resampled (noR). In total, we used around 190–220 measures from CEPS at various scales, depending on the analysis undertaken, with our investigation focused on three families of measures: 22 fractal dimension (FD) measures, 40 heart rate asymmetries or measures derived from Poincar{\'e} plots (HRA), and 8 measures based on permutation entropy (PE). Results: FDs for the RRi data differentiated strongly between breathing rates, whether data were resampled or not, increasing between 5 and 7 breaths per minute (BrPM). Largest effect sizes for RRi (4R and noR) differentiation between breathing rates were found for the PE-based measures. Measures that both differentiated well between breathing rates and were consistent across different RRi data lengths (1–5 min) included five PE-based (noR) and three FDs (4R). Of the top 12 measures with short-data values consistently within ± 5% of their values for the 5-min data, five were FDs, one was PE-based, and none were HRAs. Effect sizes were usually greater for CEPS measures than for those implemented in DynamicalSystems.jl. Conclusion: The updated CEPS software enables visualisation and analysis of multichannel physiological data using a variety of established and recently introduced complexity entropy measures. Although equal resampling is theoretically important for FD estimation, it appears that FD measures may also be usefully applied to non-resampled data.",

abstract = "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been extensively studied to understand and reproduce the capabilities of the human brain. According to the biophysical properties of biological neurons, a variety of neuronal models have been proposed. Previous work has modelled SNNs as timed automata by representing each neuron as an automaton. Having a formal computational model of spiking neural networks will help in understanding the relationship between the underlying structure and the corresponding behaviour. We suggest a formal model of a finite state transducer (FST) to describe the functioning of minimal SNNs evolved to perform temporal pattern recognition. The operation and the constituents of the evolved SNNs are found to have a one to one correspondence with the 6 tuple of a FST that maps the input string ABC to the output string {0, 1}. Thus, a spiking neural network recognising a temporal pattern of three signals can be formalised as a 6 tuple machine, SNN = (Q, Σ, ∆, q0, F, σ), where Q is the finite set of network states, the spiking of interneurons in the interval following an input signal describes a network state = {start, hA, hAB, hABC}, Σ is the finite set of input channels = {A, B, C}, ∆ represents the finite set of spiking behaviours of the output neurons {spiking, quiet}, q0 is the starting state of the network (the spiking behaviour of interneurons when the network receives a signal in the wrong order), F is the finite set of final states (when the network receives signals in the correct order ABC) = {hABC}, and σ defines transitions between network states σ ⊆ Q × Σ × ∆ × Q. The evolved network receives a continuous input stream and produces spike(s) in the output neuron only if the signals are received in the correct order (Figure 1a). A segment of the spiking activity in the network is shown in Figure 1b. Before the onset of the first correct signal (around 350 ms), the network is in the start state (continuous spiking of neurons N1 and N2). When the network receives the first target signal A, N1 speeds up and shuts down N2 – transforming the network to hA state, represented by continuous spiking of N1. The persistent spiking of N1 also prevents the output neuron from spiking. Subsequently, when the network receives a signal on channel B, it shuts down N1 and transforms to the hAB state, enabling the output neuron to spike when receiving the last target signal C. The analysis of the evolved SNNs revealed that these transitions between network states accomplish temporal pattern recognition. Moreover, we demonstrate that the behaviour of a spiking neural network can be formalised as a finite state transducer. In future, we plan to wire minimal SNNs together to build larger systems that can recognise complex patterns. ",

The interpretation of these medical examinations and the a patient{\textquoteright}s demographics are usually textual data, which is burned in on the pixel content of medical image modalities (MIM). Example of these MIM includes Ultrasound and X-ray imaging. As artificial intelligence advances for medical applications, there is a high demand for the accessibility of these burned-in textual data for various needs. This paper aims to review the significance of burned-in textual data recognition in MIM and recent research regarding the machine learning approach, challenges, and open issues for further investigation on this application. The paper describes the significant problems in this study area as low resolution and background interference of text. Finally, the paper suggests applying more advanced deep learning ensemble algorithms as possible solutions.",

abstract = "An accurate and robust Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) method proves surprising versatility in an Intelligent Transportation and Surveillance (ITS) system. However, most of the existing approaches often use prior knowledge or fixed pre-and-post processing rules and are thus limited by poor generalization in complex real-life conditions. In this paper, we leverage a YOLO-based end-to-end generic ALPR pipeline for vehicle detection (VD), license plate (LP) detection and recognition without exploiting prior knowledge or additional steps in inference. We assess the whole ALPR pipeline, starting from vehicle detection to the LP recognition stage, including a vehicle classifier for emergency vehicles and heavy trucks. We used YOLO v2 in the initial stage of the pipeline and remaining stages are based on the state-of-the-art YOLO v4 detector with various data augmentation and generation techniques to obtain LP recognition accuracy on par with current proposed methods. To evaluate our approach, we used five public datasets from different regions, and we achieved an average recognition accuracy of 90.3% while maintaining an acceptable frames per second (FPS) on a low-end GPU.",

title = "A transfer learning-based system for grading breast invasive ductal carcinoma",
abstract = "Breast carcinoma is a sort of malignancy that begins in the breast. Breast malignancy cells generally structure a tumour that can routinely be seen on an x-ray or felt like a lump. Despite advances in screening, treatment, and observation that have improved patient endurance rates, breast carcinoma is the most regularly analyzed malignant growth and the subsequent driving reason for malignancy mortality among ladies. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most boundless breast malignant growth with about 80% of all analyzed cases. It has been found from numerous types of research that artificial intelligence has tremendous capabilities, which is why it is used in various sectors, especially in the healthcare domain. In the initial phase of the medical field, mammography is used for diagnosis, and finding cancer in the case of a dense breast is challenging. The evolution of deep learning and applying the same in the findings are helpful for earlier tracking and medication. The authors have tried to utilize the deep learning concepts for grading breast invasive ductal carcinoma using Transfer Learning in the present work. The authors have used five transfer learning approaches here, namely VGG16, VGG19, InceptionReNetV2, DenseNet121, and DenseNet201 with 50 epochs in the Google Colab platform which has a single 12GB NVIDIA Tesla K80 graphical processing unit (GPU) support that can be used up to 12 h continuously. The dataset used for this work can be openly accessed from http://databiox.com. The experimental results that the authors have received regarding the algorithm's accuracy are as follows: VGG16 with 92.5%, VGG19 with 89.77%, InceptionReNetV2 with 84.46%, DenseNet121 with 92.64%, DenseNet201 with 85.22%. From the experimental results, it is clear that the DenseNet121 gives the maximum accuracy in terms of cancer grading, whereas the InceptionReNetV2 has minimal accuracy.",

title = "Sentiment Analysis using {BLSTM-ResNet} on Textual Images",
abstract = "Sentiment Analysis is a popular classification problem where the degree of emotion is analysed based on text. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) are part of various sentiment classification models, but their use has been limited toone-dimensional (1D) convolution or shallow two-dimensional (2D) convolution. The primary focus of this research is to use deep 2D-CNN architectures, inspired by the popular computer vision model ResNet, to replace a shallow 2D-CNN in an existing BLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory)-2DCNN model. This research investigates a new method for sentiment analysis which is an amalgam of the practices popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well as Computer Vision, striving to extract opinions from a text by transformingtext into images. The text images are formed by transforming the word embeddings matrix into a greyscale image with the help of BLSTM cell. Intensive experiments have been conducted on the Sentiment140 dataset with our novel BLSTM-ResNet model, which contains residual blocks with skip connections. Several BLSTM-ResNet variants were tested to investigate the impact ofnetwork depth and dataset size on sentiment detection. Moreover, two sets of residual blocks are designed to form our shallow and deep BLSTM-ResNet models. Our best shallow BLSTM-ResNet models have achieved 4.06% and 3.43% increases in accuracy for dataset sizes 80,000 and 200,000 respectively, compared with the baseline BLSTM-2DCNN model. In addition, an overall improvement is observed on accuracy with every additional residual blockin our shallow BLSTM-ResNet model until accuracy saturates, and the same trend has been seen on the impact of dataset size on the performance. Our deep BLSTM-ResNet models show the same positive impact of network depth impact and dataset size on sentiment analysis. Further investigation on the shallow anddeep BLSTM-ResNet models shows that deep BLSTM-ResNet outperforms shallow BLSTM-ResNet, in general.",

  title     = {Mapping odorant sensitivities reveals a sparse but structured representation of olfactory chemical space by sensory input to the mouse olfactory bulb},
  abstract  = {In olfactory systems, convergence of sensory neurons onto glomeruli generates a map of odorant receptor identity. How glomerular maps relate to sensory space remains unclear. We sought to better characterize this relationship in the mouse olfactory system by defining glomeruli in terms of the odorants to which they are most sensitive. Using high-throughput odorant delivery and ultrasensitive imaging of sensory inputs, we imaged responses to 185 odorants presented at concentrations determined to activate only one or a few glomeruli across the dorsal olfactory bulb. The resulting datasets defined the tuning properties of glomeruli - and, by inference, their cognate odorant receptors - in a low-concentration regime, and yielded consensus maps of glomerular sensitivity across a wide range of chemical space. Glomeruli were extremely narrowly tuned, with ~25% responding to only one odorant, and extremely sensitive, responding to their effective odorants at sub-picomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Such narrow tuning in this concentration regime allowed for reliable functional identification of many glomeruli based on a single diagnostic odorant. At the same time, the response spectra of glomeruli responding to multiple odorants was best predicted by straightforward odorant structural features, and glomeruli sensitive to distinct odorants with common structural features were spatially clustered. These results define an underlying structure to the primary representation of sensory space by the mouse olfactory system.},

  title     = {Rapid Recognition of Olfactory Scenes with a Portable {MOx} Sensor System using Hotplate Modulation},
  abstract  = {A caf{\'e}, the metro, a supermarket, a book store - many locations of everyday life have a specific smell. Recognising such olfactory scenes could inform personal activity tracking, environmental monitoring, and assist robotic navigation. Yet it is unclear if current Metal-oxide (MOx) sensor technology is sensitive and specific enough to achieve this. Factors like sensor drift, and sensitivity to ambient humidity and temperature further complicate the recognition of olfactory scenes. Hotplate temperature modulation has been suggested as a method to counter these drawbacks. We present an electronic nose based on MEMS-MOx sensors that support rapid hotplate temperature modulation with a 150 ms period. We recorded different natural olfactory scenes in an urban context. A linear SVM was able to recognise four olfactory scenes in single hotplate cycles with near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same day, and 73% accuracy when tested in the same locations on the next day. Gas sensor responses yielded higher recognition accuracy than humidity, temperature, and pressure, which were also partly-location specific. Our results indicate that hotplate modulation enables recognition of natural odor scenes across extended timespans. These findings encourage the use of MOx-sensors as rapid sensing devices in natural, uncontrolled environments.},

title = "{EEG} microstates: Functional significance and short-term test-retest reliability",
abstract = "EEG microstates, reflecting discrete topographical organization of the EEG signal power, may have clinical relevance; however, their functional significance and test-retest reliability remain unclear. To investigate the functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes and their pairwise transitions, and to establish their within-session test-retest reliability, we recorded 36-channel EEGs in 20 healthy volunteers during three eyes-closed conditions: mind-wandering, verbalization (silently repeating the word {\textquoteleft}square{\textquoteright} every 2 s), and visualization (visualizing a square every 2 s). Each condition lasted 3 min and the sequence of three conditions was repeated four times (two runs of two sequence repetitions). The participants' alertness and their sense of effort during the experiment were rated using visual-analogue scales. The EEG data were 2–20 Hz bandpass-filtered and analysed into the four canonical microstate classes: A, B, C, and D. EEG microstate classes C and D were persistently more dominant than classes A and B in all conditions. Of the first-order microstate parameters, average microstate duration was most reliable. The duration of class D microstate was longer during mind-wandering (106.8 ms) than verbalization (102.2 ms) or visualization (99.8 ms), with a concomitantly higher coverage (36.4% vs. 34.7% and 35.2%), but otherwise there was no clear association of the four microstate classes to particular mental states. The test-retest reliability was higher at the beginning of each run, together with higher average alpha power and subjective ratings of alertness. Only the transitions between classes C and D (from C to D in particular) were significantly higher than what would be expected from the respective microstates' occurrences. The transition probabilities, however, did not distinguish between conditions, and their test-retest reliability was overall lower than that of the first-order parameters such as duration and coverage. Further studies are needed to establish the functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes. This might be more fruitfully achieved by looking at their complex syntax beyond pairwise transitions. To ensure greater test-retest reliability of microstate parameters, study designs should allow for shorter experimental runs with regular breaks, particularly when using EEG microstates as clinical biomarkers.",

In this way we solve the edge-to-edge reachability case of an open problem due to Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider [4]. This implies that the interval-to-interval version of the classical open problem of reachability for regular piecewise affine maps (PAMs) is also decidable.

  title     = {Rapid Inference of Geographical Location with an Event-based Electronic Nose},
  abstract  = {Sensory information determines successful interaction of an agent with its environment. Animals have been shown to be able to encode rapid fluctuations in odour plumes, but this has yet received little attention in electronic gas sensing. State-of-the-art gas sensors actively modify the sensing site using temperature modulation, which decreases the integration time and increases the discriminability. In this work, we propose a novel approach for asynchronous event sampling for temperature-modulated gas sensor data and investigate the effectiveness of different event encoding schemes for solving an inference problem. A multichannel heater-modulated electronic nose was used to record field data at 1kHz. The data consisted of an approx. 90-minute walk in Lisbon covering multiple chemical environments and olfactory sceneries. Single temperature-cycle sensor conductance windows of 140ms were normalised and a model curve was subtracted from each sensor response. Using send-on-delta sampling, on- and off-events were generated and further compressed by considering either their rate, time-to-first-spike, firing-order, or a reconstructed signal. The different representations were assessed by their performance in inferring geographical location on unseen single 140 ms cycles using a linear SVM (75%/25% training/test split). We found that with a small spiking threshold the event-reconstructed signal achieved 82.5±1.0% accuracy, very close to the raw data (84.2±1.2%), and gracefully degraded when reducing the event count by increasing the spike threshold. The rate, latency and rank-order codes could not match that of the reconstructed signal, suggesting that temporal dynamics of the intra-cycle signal contain essential information. We conclude that heater-modulated gas sensors lend themselves to event-based processing, allowing for rapid inference in the sub-second regime. Our work could pave the way from distinguishing broad olfactory scenes to recognising individual odorants in turbulent plumes, with the potential to break new ground in traditional and neuromorphic gas sensing.},

Previous work on this structure has mostly looked at fixed and static connections. However, we argue that such static structures cannot be optimal in all situations. We introduce a dynamic hierarchical connection system of sub-schedulers between the scheduler and servers, and use artificial intelligence search algorithms to optimise this structure. Due to its dynamic and flexible nature, this design enables the system to adaptively accommodate heterogeneous jobs and resources to make the most use of resources. Experimental results compare genetic algorithms and simulating annealing for optimising the structure, and demonstrate that a dynamic hierarchical structure can significantly reduce the total makespan (max processing time for given jobs) of the heterogeneous tasks allocated to heterogeneous resources, compared with a one-layer structure. This reduction is particularly pronounced when resources are scarce. },

title = "Modelling a permanent magnet synchronous motor in {FEniCSx} for parallel high-performance simulations",
abstract = "There are concerns that the extreme requirements of heavy-duty vehicles and aviation will see them left behind in the electrification of the transport sector, becoming the most significant emitters of greenhouse gases. Engineers extensively use the finite element method to analyse and improve the performance of electric machines, but new highly scalable methods with a linear (or near) time complexity are required to make extreme-scale models viable. This paper introduces a three-dimensional permanent magnet synchronous motor model using FEniCSx, a finite element platform tailored for efficient computing and data handling at scale. The model demonstrates comparable magnetic flux density distributions to a verification model built in Ansys Maxwell with a maximum deviation of 7% in the motor{\textquoteright}s static regions. Solving the largest mesh, comprising over eight million cells, displayed a speedup of 198 at 512 processes. A preconditioned Krylov subspace method was used to solve the system, requiring 92% less memory than a direct solution. It is expected that advances built on this approach will allow system-level multiphysics simulations to become feasible within electric machine development. This capability could provide the near real-world accuracy needed to bring electric propulsion systems to large vehicles.",

  title     = {Boosting Ant Colony Optimization with Reptile Search Algorithm for Churn Prediction},
  abstract  = {The telecommunications industry is greatly concerned about customer churn due to dissatisfaction with service. This industry has started investing in the development of machine learning (ML) models for churn prediction to extract, examine and visualize their customers{\textquoteright} historical information from a vast amount of big data which will assist to further understand customer needs and take appropriate actions to control customer churn. However, the high-dimensionality of the data has a large influence on the performance of the ML model, so feature selection (FS) has been applied since it is a primary preprocessing step. It improves the ML model{\textquoteright}s performance by selecting salient features while reducing the computational time, which can assist this sector in building effective prediction models. This paper proposes a new FS approach ACO-RSA, that combines two metaheuristic algorithms (MAs), namely, ant colony optimization (ACO) and reptile search algorithm (RSA). In the developed ACO-RSA approach, an ACO and RSA are integrated to choose an important subset of features for churn prediction. The ACO-RSA approach is evaluated on seven open-source customer churn prediction datasets, ten CEC 2019 test functions, and its performance is compared to particle swarm optimization (PSO), multi verse optimizer (MVO) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO), standard ACO and standard RSA. According to the results along with statistical analysis, ACO-RSA is an effective and superior approach compared to other competitor algorithms on most datasets.},

  title     = {Drift in a Popular Metal Oxide Sensor Dataset Reveals Limitations for Gas Classification Benchmarks},
  abstract  = {Metal oxide (MOx) gas sensors are a popular choice for many applications, due to their tuneable sensitivity, space efficiency and low cost. Publicly available sensor datasets are particularly valuable for the research community as they accelerate the development and evaluation of novel algorithms for gas sensor data analysis. A dataset published in 2013 by Vergara and colleagues contains recordings from MOx gas sensor arrays in a wind tunnel. It has since become a standard benchmark in the field. Here we report a latent property of this dataset that limits its suitability for gas classification studies. Measurement timestamps show that gases were recorded in separate, temporally clustered batches. Sensor baseline response before gas exposure were strongly correlated with the recording batch, to the extent that baseline response was largely sufficient to infer the gas used in a given trial. Zero-offset baseline compensation did not resolve the issue, since residual short-term drift still contained enough information for gas/trial identification using a machine learning classifier. A subset of the data recorded within a short period of time was minimally affected by drift and suitable for gas classification benchmarking after offset-compensation, but with much reduced classification performance compared to the full dataset. We found 18 publications where this dataset was used without precautions against the circumstances we describe, thus potentially overestimating the accuracy of gas classification algorithms. These observations highlight potential pitfalls in using previously recorded gas sensor data, which may have distorted widely reported results.},

  abstract  = {There is growing on-going research into how footballer attributes, collected prior to, during and post-match, may address the demands of clubs, media pundits and gaming developers. Focusing upon individual player performance analysis and prediction, we examined the body of research which considers different player attributes. This resulted in the selection of 132 relevant papers published between 1999 and 2020. From these we have compiled a comprehensive list of player attributes, categorising them as static, such as age and height, or dynamic, such as pass completions and shots on target. To indicate their accuracy, we classified each attribute as objectively or subjectively derived, and finally by their implied accessibility and their likely personal and club sensitivity. We assigned these attributes to 25 logical groups such as passing, tackling and player demographics. We analysed the relative research focus on each group and noted the analytical methods deployed, identifying which statistical or machine learning techniques were used. We reviewed and considered the use of character trait attributes in the selected papers and discuss more formal approaches to their use. Based upon this we have made recommendations on how this work may be developed to support elite clubs in the consideration of transfer targets.},

title = "A Novel Ensemble Machine Learning and an Evolutionary Algorithm in Modeling the {COVID-19} Epidemic and Optimizing Government Policies",
abstract = "The spread of the COVID-19 disease has prompted a need for immediate reaction by governments to curb the pandemic. Many countries have adopted different policies and studies are performed to understand the effect of each of the policies on the growth rate of the infected cases. In this article, the data about the policies taken by all countries at each date, and the effect of the policies on the growth rate of the pandemic are used to build a model of the pandemic's behavior. The model takes as input a set of policies and predicts the growth rate of the pandemic. Then, a population-based multi objective optimization algorithm is developed, which uses the model to search through the policy space and finds a set of policies that minimize the cost induced to the society due to the policies and the growth rate of the pandemic. Because of the complexity of the modeling problem and the uncertainty in measuring the growth rate of the pandemic via the models, an ensemble learning algorithm is proposed in this article to improve the performance of individual learning algorithms. The ensemble consists of ten learning algorithms and a metamodel algorithm that is built to predict the accuracy of each learning algorithm for a given data record. The metamodel is a set of support vector machine (SVM) algorithms that is used in the aggregation phase of the ensemble algorithm. Because there is uncertainty in measuring the growth rate via the models, a landscape smoothing operator is proposed in the optimization process, which aims at reducing uncertainty. The algorithm is tested on open access data online and experiments on the ensemble learning and the policy optimization algorithms are performed.",

title = "Synchronization Through Uncorrelated Noise in Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks",
abstract = "Gamma rhythms play a major role in many different processes in the brain, such as attention, working memory, and sensory processing. While typically considered detrimental, counterintuitively noise can sometimes have beneficial effects on communication and information transfer. Recently, Meng and Riecke showed that synchronization of interacting networks of inhibitory neurons in the gamma band (i.e., gamma generated through an ING mechanism) increases while synchronization within these networks decreases when neurons are subject to uncorrelated noise. However, experimental and modeling studies point towardz an important role of the pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma (PING) mechanism in the cortex. Therefore, we investigated the effect of uncorrelated noise on the communication between excitatory-inhibitory networks producing gamma oscillations via a PING mechanism. Our results suggest that, at least in a certain range of noise strengths and natural frequency differences between the regions, synaptic noise can have a supporting role in facilitating inter-regional communication, similar to the ING case for a slightly larger parameter range. Furthermore, the noise-induced synchronization between networks is generated via a different mechanism than when synchronization is mediated by strong synaptic coupling. Noise-induced synchronization is achieved by lowering synchronization within networks which allows the respective other network to impose its own gamma rhythm resulting in synchronization between networks.",

  title     = {{EEG} Spectral Feature Modulations Associated with Fatigue in Robot-Mediated Upper Limb Gross and Fine Motor Interactions},
  abstract  = {This paper investigates the EEG spectral feature modulations associated with fatigue induced by robot-mediated upper limb gross and fine motor interactions. Twenty healthy participants were randomly assigned to perform a gross motor interaction with Haptic MASTER or a fine motor interaction with SCRIPT passive orthosis for 20 minutes or until volitional fatigue. Relative and ratio band power measures were estimated from the EEG data recorded before and after the robot-mediated interactions. Paired samples t-tests found a significant increase in the relative alpha band power and a significant decrease in the relative delta band power due to the fatigue induced by the robot-mediated gross and fine motor interactions. The gross motor task also significantly increased the (θ + α)/β and α/β ratio band power measures, whereas the fine motor task increased the relative theta band power. Furthermore, the robot-mediated gross movements mostly changed the EEG activity around the central and parietal brain regions, whereas the fine movements mostly changed the EEG activity around the frontopolar and central brain regions. The subjective ratings suggest that the gross motor task may have induced physical fatigue, whereas the fine motor task may have induced mental fatigue. Therefore, findings affirm that changes to localised brain activity patterns indicate fatigue developed from the robot-mediated interactions. It can also be concluded that the regional differences in the prominent EEG spectral features are most likely due to the differences in the nature of the task (fine/gross motor and distal/proximal upper limb) that may have differently altered an individual{\textquoteright}s physical and mental fatigue level. The findings could potentially be used in future to detect fatigue during robot-mediated post-stroke therapies.},

The results show that the transformer-based models outperform their convolutional counterparts yielding F1-scores in the range [70.33%, 75.76%].

  title     = {The beta component of gamma-band auditory steady-state responses in patients with schizophrenia},
  abstract  = {Abstract: The mechanisms underlying circuit dysfunctions in schizophrenia (SCZ) remain poorly understood. Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs), especially in the gamma and beta band, have been suggested as a potential biomarker for SCZ. While the reduction of 40 Hz power for 40 Hz drive has been well established and replicated in SCZ patients, studies are inconclusive when it comes to an increase in 20 Hz power during 40 Hz drive. There might be several factors explaining the inconsistencies, including differences in the sensitivity of the recording modality (EEG vs MEG), differences in stimuli (click-trains vs amplitude-modulated tones) and large differences in the amplitude of the stimuli. Here, we used a computational model of ASSR deficits in SCZ and explored the effect of three SCZ-associated microcircuit alterations: reduced GABA activity, increased GABA decay times and NMDA receptor hypofunction. We investigated the effect of input strength on gamma (40 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) band power during gamma ASSR stimulation and saw that the pronounced increase in beta power during gamma stimulation seen experimentally could only be reproduced in the model when GABA decay times were increased and only for a specific range of input strengths. More specifically, when the input was in this specific range, the rhythmic drive at 40 Hz produced a strong 40 Hz rhythm in the control network; however, in the {\textquoteleft}SCZ-like{\textquoteright} network, the prolonged inhibition led to a so-called {\textquoteleft}beat-skipping{\textquoteright}, where the network would only strongly respond to every other input. This mechanism was responsible for the emergence of the pronounced 20 Hz beta peak in the power spectrum. The other two microcircuit alterations were not able to produce a substantial 20 Hz component but they further narrowed the input strength range for which the network produced a beta component when combined with increased GABAergic decay times. Our finding that the beta component only existed for a specific range of input strengths might explain the seemingly inconsistent reporting in experimental studies and suggests that future ASSR studies should systematically explore different amplitudes of their stimuli. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic link between a microcircuit alteration and an electrophysiological marker in schizophrenia and argue that more complex ASSR stimuli are needed to disentangle the nonlinear interactions of microcircuit alterations. The computational modelling approach put forward here is ideally suited to facilitate the development of such stimuli in a theory-based fashion.},

Olfaction is now increasingly seen as a “wide-bandwidth temporal sense” (Ackels et al., 2021; Nagel et al., 2015). A parallel transition is occurring in odor-guided robot navigation, where it has been discovered that sensors can access temporal cues useful for navigation (Schmuker et al., 2016). We are only beginning to understand the implications of this paradigm-shift on our view of olfactory and olfactomotor circuits. Below we review insights into the information encoded in turbulent odor plumes and shine light on how animals could access this information. We suggest that a key challenge for olfactory neuroscience is to re-interpret work based on static stimuli in the context of natural odor dynamics and actively exploring animals.},

  abstract  = {Making class balance is essential when learning from highly skewed datasets; otherwise, a learner may classify all instances to a negative class, resulting in a high false-negative rate. As a result, a precise balancing strategy is required. Many researchers have investigated class imbalance using Machine Learning (ML) methods due to their powerful generalization performance and interpreting capabilities, comparing with random sampling techniques, to handle the problem of class imbalance in the preprocessing phase to facilitate learning process and improve performance results of learners. In this research, an effective method called HEOMGA is presented by combining Heterogeneous Euclidean-Overlap Metric (HEOM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for oversampling minority class. The HEOM is employed to define a fitness function for the GA. To assess the performance of the proposed HEOMGA method, three benchmark datasets from UCI repository in the domain of customer churn prediction are examined using three different ML learners and evaluated with three performance metrics. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to some popular oversample methods, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, G SMOTE, and Gaussian oversampling methods. The HEOMGA method significantly outperformed the other oversampling methods in terms of recall, G mean, and AUC when the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used.},

  abstract     = {Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model of peripheral lesioning and accurately reproduced the characteristics of network repair after deafferentation that are reported in experiments to study the activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we model deafferentation in a biologically realistic balanced network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed structural plasticity growth rules and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network both contribute to the restoration of the network to pre-deafferentation stable activity levels.},

  abstract  = {The nervous systems converts the physical quantities sensed by its primary receptors into trains of events that are then processed in the brain. The unmatched efficiency in information processing has long inspired engineers to seek brain-likeapproaches to sensing and signal processing. The key principle pursued in neuromorphic sensing is to shed the traditional approach of periodic sampling in favor of an the event-driven scheme that mimicks sampling as it occurs in the nervous system, where events are preferably emitted upon the change of the sensed stimulus. In this paper we highlight the advantages and challenges of event-based sensing and signal processing in the visual, auditory and olfactory domains. We also provide a survey of the literature covering neuromorphic sensing and signal processing in all three modalities. Our aim is to facilitate research in event-based sensing and signal processing by providing a comprehensive overview of the research performed previously as well as highlighting conceptual advantages, current progress and future challenges in the field.},

  abstract  = {Electronic olfaction can help detect and localize harmful gases and pollutants, but the turbulence of the natural environment presents a particular challenge: Odor encounters are intermittent, and an effective electronic nose must therefore be able to resolve short odor pulses. The slow responses of the widely used metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors complicate the task. Here, we combine high-resolution data acquisition with a processing method based on Kalman filtering and absolute-deadband sampling to extract fast onset events. We find that our system can resolve the onset time of odor encounters with enough precision for source direction estimation with a pair of MOX sensors in a stereo-osmic configuration.},

  abstract  = {The telecommunication (telecom)industry is a highly technological domain has rapidly developed over the previous decades as a result of the commercial success in mobile communication and the internet. Due to the strong competition in the telecom industry market, companies use a business strategy to better understand their customers{\textquoteright} needs and measure their satisfaction. This helps telecom companies to improve their retention power and reduces the probability to churn. Knowing the reasons behind customer churn and the use of Machine Learning (ML) approaches for analyzing customers' information can be of great value for churn management. This paper aims to study the importance of Customer Churn Prediction (CCP) and recent research in the field of CCP. Challenges and open issues that need further research and development to CCP in the telecom sector are explored},

  abstract     = {Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model, simulations of which accurately reproduce network rewiring after peripheral lesions as reported in experiments, to study these activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we deafferent a biologically realistic network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed model of homeostatic structural plasticity and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network are both necessary for successful rewiring of the network.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the mammalian motor cortex encode physical parameters of voluntary movements during planning and execution of a motor task. Brain-machine interfaces can decode limb movements from the activity of these neurons in real time. One future goal is to control prosthetic devices in severely paralyzed patients or to restore communication if the ability to speak or make gestures is lost. Here, we implemented a spiking neural network that decodes movement intentions from the activity of individual neurons recorded in the motor cortex of a monkey. The network runs on neuromorphic hardware and performs its computations in a purely spike-based fashion. It incorporates an insect-brain-inspired, three-layer architecture with 176 neurons. Cortical signals are filtered using lateral inhibition, and the network is trained in a supervised fashion to predict two opposing directions of the monkey's arm reaching movement before the movement is carried out. Our network operates on the actual spikes that have been emitted by motor cortical neurons, without the need to construct intermediate nonspiking representations. Using a pseudo-population of 12 manually selected neurons, it reliably predicts the movement direction with an accuracy of 89.3% on data not encountered during model training, after only 100 training trials. Our results provide a proof of concept for the first-time use of a neuromorphic device for decoding movement intentions.},
