------------

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising technique that could provide
treatment for patients with cerebellar disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms of
the action of TMS on the cerebellum are still unknown. Our goal is to study the effects of
TMS on the cerebellum. 
We developed a model of the cerebellum. We stimulated all compartments of all neurons with 
a square wave, whose amplitude is solely dependent on the distance between the neuron 
compartment and the source of the stimulus. The stimulus was applied as a voltage using the 
extracellular mechanism in NEURON. We modelled the stimulus with frequencies of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Hz. 
The higher the stimulus frequency, the bigger the amplitude of the modulation. For stimulus 
frequencies above 50 Hz, the Purkinje cell’s instantaneous firing rate no longer oscillates 
in accordance with the stimulus. 
We show that stimulus frequency can significantly impact the cell’s behaviour, highlighting the
importance of carefully selecting this parameter in clinical settings. Future work will
employ a more realistic simulation model.
