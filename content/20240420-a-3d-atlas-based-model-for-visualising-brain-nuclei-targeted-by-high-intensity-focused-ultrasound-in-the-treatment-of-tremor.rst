On this week's Journal Club session, Nada Yousif will talk about her paper under review in the presentation entitled "A 3D atlas-based model for visualising brain nuclei targeted by high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of tremor".

------------

Essential tremor is a common movement disorder which impacts significantly on activities
of daily living. One treatment is high intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) is a non-
invasive technique which thermally ablates the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the
thalamus. However, the VIM is a small nucleus, impossible to visualise on clinical MRI.
Therefore, we constructed a three-dimensional computational model based on data from a
brain atlas to improve the visualisation of VIM with the aim of optimising targeting and
post-treatment analysis. We show that the clinical targeting approach and actual lesion
locations can be plotted in the model to understand their relation to the neuroanatomy.
Future directions will also be discussed with respect to imaging-based models and
modelling the impact of heating and ablation on thalamic neurons and networks.
