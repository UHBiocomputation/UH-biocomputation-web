:summary: Simon O'Connor's Journal Club session entitled "Does combinatorial coding hinder the understanding of structure odour relationships in human olfaction?".

On this week's Journal Club session, Simon O'Connor will give the talk "Does combinatorial coding hinder the understanding of structure odour relationships in human olfaction?".

------------

Since Malcolm Dyson first suggested a vibrational theory of smell in 1928 proponents of
the competing theories of olfaction have struggled for nearly a century to make sense of
how the chemical structure of odour molecules elicit the perception of odours. Here I will
give a short introduction to the olfactory system. I will then discuss a dataset that I
constructed from fragrance industry catalogues, Infrared Spectra simulations using
‘Gaussian’ modelling software and RDkit bit vectors based on the structure of the
molecules. Next, I will describe KNN and Random Forrest studies in which I probe the
dataset before moving on to hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. I will then talk
about Hyperbolic Hierarchical Clustering (HypHC) software and whether an embeddings-based
approach might be the right approach considering the combinatorial nature of the receptor
output.
