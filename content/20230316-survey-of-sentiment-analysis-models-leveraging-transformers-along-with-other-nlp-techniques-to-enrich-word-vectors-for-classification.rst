:summary: Harpreet Singh's Journal Club session 

This week on Journal Club session Harpreet Singh will talk about his recent work on "Survey of Sentiment Analysis models leveraging transformers along with other NLP techniques to enrich word vectors for classification".

------------

In recent years, the development of large language models (LLMs) such as the
GPT series has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) research,
rendering many specialized models obsolete. Rather than focusing on individual
tasks, researchers are now prioritizing the creation of general-purpose
language understanding systems capable of performing multiple tasks.
Competitive evaluation criteria, such as the Glue score, are being used to
evaluate these models. However, due to the limited resources of many
universities, they are unable to undertake such research and instead continue
to work on text classification tasks. Sentiment analysis is a popular text
classification task, and researchers are now incorporating transformers and
other techniques to improve performance on sentiment analysis datasets. In this
journal club meeting, we will discuss various models that leverage transformers
and other techniques to enhance sentiment analysis performance.
