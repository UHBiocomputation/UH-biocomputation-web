:summary: Muhammad Yaqoob's Journal Club session where he will talk about "Understanding structure-function mapping in small spiking neural networks.".

On this week's Journal Club session, Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about his work in the presentation entitled "Understanding structure-function mapping in small spiking neural networks.".

------------

We know that the precise timing of spikes represents information in spiking neuronal
networks. However, the information processing in spiking networks is not yet fully
understood. One way to understand the working mechanism of a spiking network is to
associate the structural connectivity of the network with the corresponding functional
behaviour. In this journal club, I will begin with an introduction to different spiking
neuron models and their properties. Then I’ll talk about the evolution of small spiking
neural networks for temporal pattern recognition tasks. In the second half, we will
discuss the structure-function mapping in spiking neural networks evolved or created to
perform a computational task.
